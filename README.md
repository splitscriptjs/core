## About

Splitscript.js is the **_everything_** framework

This package has a CLI for easily creating event listeners, and has a dev mode for adding boilerplate code automatically
It also has an event emitter for creating other packages, like [@splitscript.js/discord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@splitscript.js/discord)

## Install

```bash
$ npm i @splitscript.js/core
```

## Dev mode

Run splitscript dev <file/folder> to add boilerplate in new listeners in the functions folder

If a file/folder is provided, splitscript will build the files in the folder, or the folder the file is in and then run that.

If its a folder, it will default to `index.ts/.js` depending on the type of project, or to the "main" set in `ss.json`

## Other packages

[`@splitscript.js/discord`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@splitscript.js/discord)
